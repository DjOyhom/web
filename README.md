# Howto

This site is based on:

* [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) as the static site framework.
* [Techdoc Hugo's theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-theme-techdoc/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/openshifttips/web) to host the git repository.
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) to run the builds and serve the content.
* [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org) (automated via Netlify) for the site certificates.

Also, we use [ForwardEmail.net](https://forwardemail.net/).

Everything is free (as in beer) so anyone can build the same stuff at 0 cost :)
Also, some of the tools used (such as Hugo and ForwardEmail) are open source as
well \o/
